# üáµüá≠ **CoreTrack Philippine Market Roadmap - UPDATED 2025**

## **Current Status: 95% Ready - Final 3 Features to Dominate PH Market**

---

## **üèÜ Phase 1: PayMongo Integration (CRITICAL BLOCKER)**
**Timeline: THIS WEEK**  
**Priority: MUST HAVE**

### **What We're Building:**
- Replace Stripe with PayMongo for **subscription billing only** (CoreTrack monthly plans)
- Support GCash, GrabPay, Maya, and card payments for subscriptions
- Keep existing direct GCash QR integration in POS (already perfect - zero fees)
- Zero upfront fees for subscription billing - only pay per successful transaction

### **Why This Matters:**
‚úÖ **Stripe doesn't work in Philippines** - blocking subscription sign-ups  
‚úÖ **Direct GCash QR in POS already works perfectly** - zero fees for customers  
‚úÖ **PayMongo for subscriptions only** - lower fees than Stripe (2.5% vs 3.9%)  
‚úÖ **"Only pay when you earn"** - perfect for CoreTrack business model  

### **Implementation Steps:**
1. Sign up at paymongo.com with Philippine business documents
2. Replace Stripe components with PayMongo SDK (subscription pages only)
3. Create subscription billing flow with GCash/GrabPay options
4. Keep existing POS GCash QR system (already perfect - zero fees)
5. Test subscription payments with real amounts (‚Ç±500-2000)

### **Success Metrics:**
- Philippine coffee shops can subscribe to CoreTrack via GCash/PayMongo
- Existing POS GCash QR system continues working perfectly (zero fees)
- Zero subscription payment processing failures

## **ü§ñ Phase 2: AI-Powered Staff Scheduling System (HIGH VALUE)**

### **Why This Solves Real Problems:**
