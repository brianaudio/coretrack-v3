# 🚨 PHASE 1: CRITICAL BLOCKER - Payment Processing

## 🎯 **What This Phase Solves**
**Problem**: Your app currently uses Stripe, which doesn't work in the Philippines. **This means your target customers (Philippine coffee shops) literally cannot pay for your service or accept payments from their customers.**

**Impact**: 🔥 **LAUNCH BLOCKER** - Without this, you have no business in PH market.

## 🛠️ **What We Need to Build**

### **PayMongo Integration** (Filipino Stripe Alternative)

#### **Two Payment Systems Needed:**

1. **POS Payments** - Help your coffee shop customers accept payments from THEIR customers
   - GCash payments (90% of Filipinos use this)
   - GrabPay, Maya payments
   - Credit/Debit cards
   - Online banking

2. **Subscription Payments** - Let coffee shops pay YOU for CoreTrack plans
   - Monthly billing: ₱199-349/month
   - GCash subscription payments (easier than credit cards)
   - Automated billing and renewals

---

## ⏱️ **Time Estimate: 2-3 Days**

### **Day 1**: PayMongo Setup & POS Integration
- Sign up for PayMongo account
- Get API keys
- Build payment forms for POS system
- Test GCash payments

### **Day 2**: Subscription Billing Integration
- Build subscription payment flows
- Connect to your existing subscription system
- Test monthly billing

### **Day 3**: Testing & Polish
- End-to-end testing
- Error handling

## 🎯 **Expected Outcome**
After Phase 1, your Philippine coffee shop customers can:
✅ Pay you monthly (₱199-349) via GCash  
✅ Accept GCash payments from their customers  
✅ Use all major Philippine payment methods  

**This alone makes you competitive in the Philippine market!**
