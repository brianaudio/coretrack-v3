# Inventory Path Fix

## Issue
There was a bug in the POS_Enhanced.tsx file where inventory paths were being incorrectly referenced using the legacy path format:
`businesses/${businessId}/branches/${branchId}/inventory`

This caused errors when trying to void orders and restore inventory, as the system couldn't find the inventory items at the incorrect path.

## Solution
1. Updated the `voidOrder` and `processVoidOrder` functions to use the proper tenant-based inventory path structure.
2. Instead of directly accessing inventory items using document paths with IDs, now using helper functions:
   - `findInventoryItemByName()` - To find the inventory item by name
   - `updateStockQuantity()` - To properly update the inventory with correct quantity tracking

## Benefits of the Fix
1. All inventory operations now use consistent paths via the helper functions in inventory.ts
2. Better error handling and logging for inventory restoration operations
3. Proper tracking of inventory movements with reasons and user information
4. Eliminates "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined" errors that were occurring due to invalid paths

## Technical Details
The system now uses:
- `tenants/${tenantId}/inventory` as the base path for inventory data
- Proper error handling to catch and log issues during restoration
- The standardized `updateStockQuantity()` function that includes inventory movement tracking
