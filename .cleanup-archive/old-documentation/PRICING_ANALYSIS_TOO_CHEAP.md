## üìä MARKET REALITY CHECK

### **Philippine Business Economics:**
1. **Minimum Wage:** ‚Ç±537-‚Ç±610/day (‚Ç±11,277-‚Ç±12,810/month)
2. **Small Restaurant Revenue:** ‚Ç±200K-‚Ç±500K/month
3. **Software Budget:** Typically 1-3% of revenue
4. **Price Sensitivity:** High - businesses very cost-conscious

### **Value Perception Analysis:**
- **‚Ç±19/month = ‚Ç±0.63/day** (Less than a cup of coffee)
- **‚Ç±79/month = ‚Ç±2.63/day** (Less than a jeepney ride)
- **‚Ç±299/month = ‚Ç±9.97/day** (Less than a fast food meal)

### **ROI Perspective:**
If CoreTrack delivers even 1% efficiency improvement:

## üî• FINAL VERDICT

### **Are you too cheap?**
**YES and NO:**

‚úÖ **Essentials (‚Ç±19):** Perfect for market penetration  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Professional (‚Ç±79):** Could be ‚Ç±99  
‚ùå **Advanced (‚Ç±149):** Should be ‚Ç±199  
‚ùå **Enterprise (‚Ç±299):** Should be ‚Ç±399+  

### **Optimal Strategy:**
1. **Keep ‚Ç±19 entry point** (competitive advantage)
2. **Increase middle/high tiers by 25-35%**
3. **Test with market data**
4. **Adjust based on real customer behavior**

The key is **value-based pricing**: if you're truly delivering 25% profit increases, customers will pay significantly more than ‚Ç±79/month for that value.

**üí≠ Bottom Line:** You're not too cheap for penetration, but you're probably too cheap for the value you deliver to growing businesses. Consider the hybrid approach!
