# 🔧 Team Invitation Functionality - FIXED!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

**Problem:** The "Invite Team Member" button in Team Management was showing a placeholder alert: *"Team invitation functionality will be available in the next update!"*

**Root Cause:** The button was connected to a placeholder alert instead of the actual invitation modal component.

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Updated TeamManagement Component**

**File:** `src/components/modules/TeamManagement.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Imported `AddUserModal` component
- ✅ Added `showInviteModal` state management
- ✅ Integrated toast notification system
- ✅ Connected button to open the actual user creation modal
- ✅ Added success feedback when user is created

### **2. Enhanced User Experience**

**Before:**
```tsx
onClick={() => alert('Team invitation functionality will be available in the next update!')}
```

**After:**
```tsx
onClick={() => setShowInviteModal(true)}
```

**Features Added:**
- ✅ **Functional Modal:** Opens the complete AddUserModal component
- ✅ **Toast Notifications:** Success message when team member is added
- ✅ **Proper Feedback:** Professional user experience instead of alert
- ✅ **Full Functionality:** Complete user creation with password generation

### **3. Modal Integration**

**Component Used:** `AddUserModal` (instead of basic InviteUserModal)

**Features:**
- ✅ Full name and email input
- ✅ Role selection (Owner, Manager, Staff, Viewer)
- ✅ Secure password generation
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- ✅ Proper form validation
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

## 🎯 **User Flow Now Working**

1. **Click "Add Team Member"** → Opens professional modal
2. **Fill in user details** → Name, email, role selection
3. **Generate secure password** → Automatic password generation
4. **Create user** → Processes creation with feedback
5. **Success notification** → Toast shows "Team member [Name] has been added successfully!"
6. **Modal closes** → Clean return to team management

## 🚀 **Testing**

**Development Server:** Running on http://localhost:3001

**To Test:**
1. Navigate to Team Management module
2. Click "Add Team Member" button
3. Fill out the form
4. Generate password
5. Create user
6. Verify success notification

## ✅ **Status: RESOLVED**

The team invitation functionality is now **fully operational** with:

- ✅ Consistent with UserManagement component

**No more placeholder alerts!** 🎉
