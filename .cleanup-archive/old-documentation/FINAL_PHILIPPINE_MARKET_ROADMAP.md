# üáµüá≠ **CoreTrack Philippine Market Roadmap - FINAL**

## **Phase 1 (Tomorrow): PayMongo Integration** 
**Priority: CRITICAL BLOCKER**

### **What We're Doing:**
- Replace Stripe with PayMongo for Philippine payment processing
- Add GCash, GrabPay, Maya support to POS system
- Keep existing English UI (perfect for Filipino customers)
- Zero upfront fees - only pay per successful transaction

### **Why This Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Stripe doesn't work in Philippines** - this is the only blocker
- ‚úÖ **GCash = 90% of Filipino customers** - instant market access
- ‚úÖ **Lower fees than Stripe** (2.5% vs 3.9%)
- ‚úÖ **Professional payment processing** for small coffee shops

### **Implementation:**
1. Sign up at paymongo.com with Philippine business docs
2. Replace Stripe components with PayMongo integration
3. Add GCash/GrabPay buttons to POS checkout
4. Test with real small amounts (‚Ç±10-20)

## **Phase 2 (Next Week): AI Shift Scheduling System**
**Priority: HIGH VALUE**

### **What We're Doing:**
- Replace complex individual dashboards with simple AI scheduler
- Input: Employee names + off requests
- Output: AI-generated weekly shift schedule
- Integrate into existing Team & Shifts page

### **Why This Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Eliminates manual scheduling headaches** for coffee shop owners
- ‚úÖ **Simple input, smart output** - just names and requests
- ‚úÖ **No employee privacy concerns** - no financial tracking
- ‚úÖ **Much more practical** than individual dashboards

### **Implementation:**
1. Create simple form for employee names and off requests
2. Build AI algorithm to balance shifts fairly
3. Generate printable weekly schedule
4. Add to Team & Shifts page

## **Phase 3 (Later): BIR Compliance**
**Priority: LOW (Only when needed)**

### **What We're Doing:**
- BIR-compliant receipts and reporting
- Only implement when businesses grow larger

### **Why Later:**
- ‚úÖ **Small coffee shops don't need this immediately**
- ‚úÖ **BIR enforcement isn't strict for small businesses**
- ‚úÖ **Focus on revenue-generating features first**

---

## **What We're NOT Doing (Confirmed Unnecessary):**
- ‚ùå **SMS notifications** - customers prefer Viber/Messenger
- ‚ùå **Filipino/Tagalog UI** - English works perfectly
- ‚ùå **Mobile optimization** - already works on tablets
- ‚ùå **Individual employee dashboards** - too complicated
- ‚ùå **Utang system** - not needed for coffee shop niche
- ‚ùå **QR menus** - small shops don't need this complexity

---

## **Timeline:**
- **Tomorrow**: PayMongo integration (critical blocker removal)
- **Next Week**: AI shift scheduling (practical value add)
- **Later**: BIR compliance (when needed)

## **Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ **PayMongo working**: Filipino customers can pay with GCash
- ‚úÖ **AI scheduler working**: Owners save time on staff scheduling
- ‚úÖ **Revenue flowing**: Philippine coffee shops start subscribing

## **Ready for Implementation Tomorrow** ‚ú®

This roadmap is focused, practical, and based on real coffee shop owner feedback. No overwhelming complexity - just two powerful features that solve actual business problems.
