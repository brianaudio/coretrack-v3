**Subject: Fellow Food Business Owner - Quick Chat**

"Hi [Owner Name]! 

I hope your coffee shop is doing amazing! I'm [Your Name] and I also run a food business here in [Your Area], so I know firsthand how challenging it can be to manage everything from inventory to daily sales while keeping customers happy. 

I recently went through a really tough period where manual tracking was costing me around â‚±30k monthly in waste and missed opportunities, which led me to create a simple POS system specifically designed for Filipino food businesses like ours. Since it's been such a game-changer for my operations, I'm now looking for 10 local coffee shop owners who might benefit from testing it out completely free for 30 days.

The system works offline (which is perfect for our unreliable internet), integrates directly with GCash and Maya, and gives you real-time insights into your inventory and profit margins per item, plus it handles staff management seamlessly. What I love most is that it's built by someone who actually understands the daily struggles of running a food business in the Philippines.

If this sounds like something that might help streamline your operations, I'd be happy to show you a quick 15-minute demo at your shop whenever it's convenient for you - no pressure at all, just one business owner helping another succeed.

Keep doing great work, and thanks for making our local food scene so vibrant! â˜•

Best,
[Your Name]

[Your Business Name]"

## **Pre-Demo Checklist**

### **The Day Before:**
