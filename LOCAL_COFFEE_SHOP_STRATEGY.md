## **üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Local Outreach Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Week 1)**
**Goal:** Gather information and build familiarity

**Daily Coffee Shop Visits:**
- Visit 2 shops per day as a regular customer
- Observe their current systems and pain points
- Build rapport with staff/owners
- Take notes on busy times and operations
- Don't pitch yet - just be a friendly regular

**What to Look For:**
- Manual inventory tracking (notebooks, whiteboards)
- Separate payment methods handling
- Staff confusion during busy periods  
- Long lines due to slow ordering process
- Owners manually counting cash/receipts
- Lack of sales data/analytics

### **Phase 2: Relationship Building (Week 2)**
**Goal:** Establish trust and credibility

**Casual Conversations:**
- "I own a food business too" - establish common ground
- Share relatable struggles: "Inventory is such a headache, right?"
- Ask about their challenges: "What's your biggest operational pain?"
- Listen more than talk
- Offer small helpful tips (non-CoreTrack related)

**Social Media Engagement:**
- Follow their Facebook/Instagram pages
- Like and comment on their posts
- Share their content occasionally
- Tag them in local community posts

### **Phase 3: Soft Introduction (Week 3)**
**Goal:** Introduce CoreTrack naturally

**The Setup:**
- Mention you've been working on a solution for business tracking
- "I built something that solved my inventory problems"
- Show genuine interest in helping them specifically
- Offer to show them what you built (no pressure)

**The Ask:**
"Would you be interested in seeing how I solved the inventory tracking problem in my business? I'm looking for local business owners to test it out - completely free for 6 months."

## **üé≠ Local Pitch Scripts**

### **Script 1: The Fellow Entrepreneur Approach**
"Hi! I'm [Name], I actually run a food business here in [Area] too. I've been coming here for my coffee and I love what you've built. 

Can I ask - what's your biggest headache when it comes to managing the business side? Like inventory, sales tracking, that stuff?

*[Listen to their response]*

Ah, I had the exact same problem! I was losing around ‚Ç±50k monthly because I had no idea what I really needed to order. So I actually built my own tracking system that solved it.

I'm looking for a few local coffee shops to test it out - completely free for 6 months. Would you be open to taking a look? I'd love to help a fellow business owner."

### **Script 2: The Problem-Solution Approach**  
"Hi [Owner Name]! I'm [Your Name], I run [Your Business] nearby.

I notice you guys are always busy - that's awesome! Can I ask what you use to track your inventory and sales? 

*[Listen - often it's notebooks or basic systems]*

I used to have the same setup and it was such a nightmare. Running out of bestsellers, ordering too much of things that would expire. 

I actually built a system that fixed all that for my business. It tracks everything automatically - inventory, sales, even GCash payments. Works offline too, which is crucial here in the Philippines.

I'm testing it with a few local coffee shops before launching publicly. Would you be interested in trying it out? It's completely free for 6 months, and I'll personally help you set it up."

### **Script 3: The Data-Driven Approach**
"Hey [Owner Name]! Love this place - I'm here almost daily for my coffee fix.

Quick question - do you know which of your menu items makes you the most profit? Not revenue, but actual profit after ingredients?

*[Most won't know exactly]*

That's what I thought - I had the same issue in my business. Turns out my best-selling item was actually losing me money!

I built a system that shows you exactly which items are profitable, tracks your inventory automatically, and even tells you when to reorder. It's saved me about ‚Ç±30k monthly.

I'm looking for local coffee shops to beta test it. Interested in seeing how it works? Completely free for 6 months."
