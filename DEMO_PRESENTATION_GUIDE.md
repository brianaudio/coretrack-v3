---

## üîÑ **Common Questions & Responses**

### **"How much will this cost after beta?"**
*"For a coffee shop your size, it would be ‚Ç±1,999 monthly after beta - but you get lifetime 50% discount, so ‚Ç±999 monthly. That's about ‚Ç±33 per day to run your entire business system. Most shops save that much daily just from better inventory management."*

### **"What if my internet goes down?"**
*"That's exactly why I built it offline-first. Everything works without internet - sales, inventory updates, everything. When internet comes back, it syncs automatically. You'll never lose a sale due to connection issues."*

### **"Is it hard to learn?"**
*"I designed it for busy coffee shop staff. If they can use a smartphone, they can use this. I personally train your team - usually takes 30 minutes to get comfortable, and they love how fast it is compared to old systems."*

### **"What about my existing data?"**
*"I'll help you transfer everything - your menu items, prices, supplier info. We can even import your past sales if you have them. And if you ever want to leave, all your data comes with you."*

### **"What if something breaks or doesn't work?"**
*"That's the advantage of working with the founder directly. You have my WhatsApp - message me anytime during business hours and I'll help immediately. No call centers, no tickets, just direct support."*

### **"Can it handle multiple locations?"**
*"Absolutely! Real-time sync between locations, centralized inventory management, consolidated reporting. Perfect if you're planning to expand."*

### **"What about my cash register/current system?"**
*"We can run them side-by-side during transition if you want. But most owners switch completely within a week because CoreTrack is faster and gives them data they never had before."*
