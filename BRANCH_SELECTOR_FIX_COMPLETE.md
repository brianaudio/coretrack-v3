# Branch Selector Fictitious Branch Issue - FIXED

## Issue Description
The branch selector dropdown was showing a fictitious "Main Branch" and "West Side Branch" even though no actual branches had been created by the user.

## Root Cause
The `BranchContext.tsx` had development mode logic that automatically fell back to mock/fictitious branches when no real branches were found in Firebase. This was designed for testing purposes but was confusing to actual users.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Development Mode Fallback Logic
- Removed the `isDevelopment` check that would show mock branches
- Removed the `mockBranches` array containing fictitious branch data
- Simplified the branch loading logic to only use real Firebase data

### 2. Modified Branch Loading Behavior
Instead of showing mock branches, the system now:
- Loads real branches from Firebase first
- If no branches exist, creates a proper default branch in Firebase
- Uses the `initializeBranchesForTenant()` function to create legitimate branches

### 3. Cleaned Up Branch Context Code

**Before (Problematic):**
```tsx
if (isDevelopment) {
  // Falls back to mock branches like "Main Branch", "West Side Branch"
  setBranches(mockBranches)
  // Auto-select mock branch
  const mainBranch = mockBranches.find(b => b.isMain) || mockBranches[0]
  setSelectedBranchState(mainBranch)
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```tsx
// Load branches on mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (profile?.tenantId) {
    loadBranches() // Only loads real Firebase branches
  }
}, [profile?.tenantId])
```

### 4. Files Modified
- `/src/lib/context/BranchContext.tsx` - Removed all development mode logic

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **No Branches Exist:** System creates a proper default branch in Firebase based on your business name
2. **Branches Exist:** Shows only your actual created branches
3. **No More Fictitious Branches:** The dropdown will only show legitimate business locations

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Check Current Branches:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console after logging in
   window.testBranchLoading = async function() {
     const { collection, getDocs, db } = await import('./src/lib/firebase.js');
     const snapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'tenants/YOUR_TENANT_ID/branches'));
     console.log('Real branches:', snapshot.size);
     snapshot.docs.forEach(doc => console.log(doc.data().name));
   }
   ```

2. **Create Real Branches:** Use the Location Management module to create actual business branches

3. **Branch Selector:** Should now only show legitimate branches, not development mock data

## Benefits

✅ **No More Confusion:** Users won't see fictitious branches they didn't create  
✅ **Real Data Only:** Branch selector shows actual business locations  
✅ **Proper Onboarding:** New users get a real default branch created  
✅ **Production Ready:** Removes development-only code that was affecting users  

## Next Steps

1. Test the branch selector in the header - it should no longer show fictitious branches
2. If you want multiple locations, use the Location Management module to create real branches
3. The system will now properly track your actual business locations and inventory per branch

---

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Fictitious branches removed from branch selector dropdown
