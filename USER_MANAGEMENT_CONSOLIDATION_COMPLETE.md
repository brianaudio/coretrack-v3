# ✅ User Management Consolidation - COMPLETED

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: We had **two separate user management systems** causing confusion:
1. **Settings → User Management Tab** - Basic user management functionality 
2. **Team Management (EnhancedTeamManagement.tsx)** - Enterprise-grade team management system

**Solution**: **Removed duplicate Settings tab** and consolidated to single Team Management system.
