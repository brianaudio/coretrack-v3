# Simple Inventory Security Checklist ✅

## Current Status: YOU'RE ALREADY SECURE ENOUGH! 🎉

Your current setup is appropriate for an inventory system:

✅ Firebase Authentication (users must log in)
✅ Multi-tenant data structure (tenants can't see each other's data)
✅ Environment variables for config
✅ Firebase hosting security

## What you DON'T need to worry about:
❌ Complex API security (you're using Firebase directly)
❌ Advanced RBAC (simple owner/user roles are fine)
❌ Payment security (no payments in inventory)
❌ Server-side validation (Firebase rules handle this)

## Quick Security Wins (Optional):
1. Add basic rate limiting in Firebase Console
2. Enable Firebase App Check (one-click in console)
3. Review Firebase rules to ensure tenant isolation

## Bottom Line:
Your current security is SUFFICIENT for an inventory management system.
Don't over-engineer it! 🚀
