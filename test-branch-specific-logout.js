/**
 * Test script to verify branch-specific logout functionality
 */

console.log('🧪 Testing Branch-Specific Logout Functionality\n');

console.log('✅ Changes implemented:');
console.log('   1. Created endActiveShiftsAtLocation() function');
console.log('   2. Updated signOutWithShiftEnd to be branch-specific');
console.log('   3. Uses current selected branch from localStorage');
console.log('   4. Only ends shifts at the current location\n');

console.log('📋 How it works now:');
console.log('   1. User clicks sign out button from any branch');
console.log('   2. System gets current selected branch from localStorage');
console.log('   3. System ends ONLY shifts at current branch location');
console.log('   4. Other branch shifts continue running');
console.log('   5. User is signed out from Firebase auth\n');

console.log('🎯 Expected behavior:');
console.log('   - Sign out from Main Branch: Only ends Main Branch shift');
console.log('   - Sign out from Downtown: Only ends Downtown shift');
console.log('   - Sign out from Mall: Only ends Mall shift');
console.log('   - Other locations remain active and accessible\n');

console.log('🔍 Real-world example:');
console.log('   🏪 Main Branch (active shift) ← You sign out here');
console.log('   🏬 Downtown Branch (active shift) ← Remains running');
console.log('   🏢 Mall Branch (active shift) ← Remains running\n');

console.log('   After sign out:');
console.log('   🏪 Main Branch (shift ended) ✅');
console.log('   🏬 Downtown Branch (still active) 🟢');
console.log('   🏢 Mall Branch (still active) 🟢\n');

console.log('🧪 To test:');
console.log('   1. Start shifts at multiple branches');
console.log('   2. Switch to a specific branch');
console.log('   3. Click sign out button');
console.log('   4. Verify only current branch shift ended');
console.log('   5. Switch to other branches and see shifts still active\n');

console.log('✅ Branch-specific logout functionality ready for testing!');
