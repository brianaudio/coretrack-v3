# 🧹 MenuBuilder Cleanup Complete

## ✅ Successfully Removed Enterprise Features

You're absolutely right - those enterprise features (Nutrition, Pricing, Templates) don't make sense for your business inventory management system. I've completely removed them and reverted the MenuBuilder back to its core functionality.

## 🗑️ What Was Removed:

### Removed Tabs:
- ❌ ~~📊 Nutrition~~ 
- ❌ ~~💰 Pricing~~
- ❌ ~~🏷️ Templates~~

### Kept Core Tabs:
- ✅ 🍽️ Menu Items (unchanged)
- ✅ ➕ Add-ons (unchanged)

## 🔧 Technical Cleanup:

### Removed Code:
- All enterprise tab navigation buttons
- All enterprise tab content sections
- All enterprise modal dialogs (nutrition, pricing, templates)
- All enterprise state variables and form states
- All enterprise imports and function calls
- All enterprise data loading from Firebase

### Cleaned State:
```typescript
// REMOVED:
const [templates, setTemplates] = useState<MenuTemplate[]>([])
const [nutritionDatabase, setNutritionDatabase] = useState<NutritionData[]>([])
const [showNutritionModal, setShowNutritionModal] = useState(false)
const [showPricingModal, setShowPricingModal] = useState(false)
const [showTemplateModal, setShowTemplateModal] = useState(false)
// ... and more enterprise states

// KEPT:
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'menu-items' | 'addons'>('menu-items')
```

### Simplified Data Loading:
```typescript
// BEFORE: Enterprise data loading
const [itemsData, categoriesData, inventoryData, addonsData, templatesData, nutritionData] = await Promise.all([...])

// AFTER: Core data loading
const [itemsData, categoriesData, inventoryData, addonsData] = await Promise.all([...])
```

## 🎯 Result:

Your MenuBuilder is now back to its clean, focused state with just the essential features:

1. **🍽️ Menu Items Tab** - Manage your menu items, categories, pricing, and inventory links
2. **➕ Add-ons Tab** - Manage add-on items with ingredient tracking

No more confusing enterprise features that don't fit your business model. The component is now streamlined and focused on core inventory management functionality.

**Status: MenuBuilder successfully cleaned up and ready to use! 🎉**
