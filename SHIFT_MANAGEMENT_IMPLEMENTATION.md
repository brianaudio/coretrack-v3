### **Shift Tracking**
- **Real-time Status**: Live shift status bar when active
- **Time Management**: Predefined shift types with automatic time suggestions
- **Staff Documentation**: Track multiple staff members per shift
- **Manager Oversight**: Managers can end shifts remotely

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Database Schema**
```typescript
interface ShiftData {
  id: string
  date: string // ISO date string
  shiftType: 'morning' | 'afternoon' | 'evening' | 'overnight'
  startTime: string // HH:mm format
  endTime: string // HH:mm format
  staffOnDuty: string[] // Array of staff names
  managerId: string // User ID who created shift
  status: 'active' | 'completed'
  createdAt: Timestamp
  completedAt?: Timestamp
}
```

### **Firebase Collections**
- **Path**: `tenants/{tenantId}/shifts`
- **Indexes**: Date, status, createdAt for efficient querying
- **Security**: Tenant-isolated data with proper access controls

### **State Management**
- Real-time shift checking on app load
- Automatic status updates via Firebase listeners
- Optimistic UI updates with error handling
- Session persistence across app restarts

## üé® User Experience

### **Lock Screen Experience**
1. **Professional Welcome**: Enterprise branding with security messaging
2. **User Context**: Display current user role and information
3. **Clear Benefits**: Explain value of shift management system
4. **Easy Access**: Large, touch-friendly "Start Shift" button
5. **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design for all devices

### **Active Shift Experience**
1. **Status Bar**: Green gradient bar showing active shift details
2. **Live Information**: Shift type, time range, staff on duty
3. **Quick Actions**: Manager/owner can end shifts directly
4. **Full Access**: Complete system unlock once shift is active

### **Shift Creation Flow**
1. **Shift Type Selection**: Visual buttons for morning/afternoon/evening/overnight
2. **Time Management**: Auto-populate times based on shift type
3. **Staff Management**: Dynamic staff list with add/remove capabilities
4. **Validation**: Ensure at least one staff member is assigned
5. **Instant Activation**: Immediate system unlock upon shift creation

## üîß Configuration

### **Shift Types and Times**
```typescript
const shiftTimes = {
  morning: { start: '06:00', end: '14:00' },
  afternoon: { start: '14:00', end: '22:00' },
  evening: { start: '22:00', end: '06:00' },
  overnight: { start: '22:00', end: '06:00' }
}
```

### **Role-Based Access**
- **Staff**: Must start shift to access POS, inventory (read-only), purchase orders
- **Manager**: Must start shift to access all manager features + can end any shift
- **Owner**: Bypasses shift requirements, has full system access always
