## ðŸ”§ Production Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration

**Create Production Environment File:**
```bash
# Copy the production template
cp .env.production .env.production.local

# Edit with your actual production values
nano .env.production.local
```

**Required Production Values:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEV_AUTH=false

# Your Firebase Production Project
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_production_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-production-project-id
# ... (see .env.production for all required variables)
```

### 2. Firebase Production Setup

**Create Production Firebase Project:**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Create new project for production
3. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
4. Create Firestore database
5. Get configuration values

**Deploy Security Rules:**
```bash
npm run deploy:rules
```

### 3. Security Validation

**Run Production Security Check:**
```bash
npm run validate:production
```

This will verify:
- âœ… All environment variables configured
- âœ… Development modes disabled
- âœ… Security settings properly set
- âœ… No sensitive files in deployment

### 4. Build and Deploy

**Build Production Application:**
```bash
npm run build:production
```

**Deploy Options:**

#### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### Option B: Netlify
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
```

#### Option C: Docker
```bash
docker build -t coretrack .
docker run -p 3000:3000 coretrack
```

### 5. Domain & SSL Setup

**Configure Custom Domain:**
1. Point your domain to deployment platform
2. Enable SSL/HTTPS (automatic on most platforms)
3. Update Firebase Auth domain settings
4. Test all authentication flows

### 6. Payment Processing Setup

**Stripe Integration (if using):**
```bash
# Add to production environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
```

**Test Payment Flows:**
- Subscription upgrades/downgrades
- Trial conversions
- Payment method updates
- Billing cycle changes

## ðŸ”’ Security Verification

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` set
- [ ] All development modes disabled
- [ ] Firebase security rules deployed
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] No development credentials in production
- [ ] Security audit panel shows all green

### Run Security Audit
```bash
# In the deployed application, go to:
Settings â†’ Security â†’ Run Security Audit
```

Should show:
- âœ… Production authentication active
- âœ… Firebase rules deployed  
- âœ… No development mode bypasses
- âœ… Proper branch isolation

## ðŸ“Š Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Authentication required everywhere
- [ ] Security audit shows healthy status

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Optimization

### Recommended Settings
```bash
# Production optimizations already included:
# - Code splitting and lazy loading
# - Image optimization
# - Database query optimization
# - Real-time subscription management
# - Memory-efficient data processing
```

### Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Optional: Add monitoring services
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Environment Variables Not Loading:**
```bash
# Verify .env.production.local exists and has correct values
# Check platform-specific environment variable settings
```

**Firebase Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Verify Firebase project ID and configuration
# Check Firestore security rules deployment
# Ensure authentication domain matches
```

**Authentication Problems:**
```bash
# Confirm NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEV_AUTH=false
# Verify Firebase Auth settings
# Check domain authorization in Firebase Console
```
