### State Management Enhancement Summary
**Advanced state management issue resolved**: Menu Builder lacked proper state persistence, causing form data loss on navigation, page refresh, or component unmounting, leading to poor user experience and data loss.

**Key Improvements**:
- âœ… Created MenuBuilderContext with React Context + useReducer pattern
- âœ… Implemented auto-save functionality with 30-second intervals and visual feedback
- âœ… Added comprehensive draft management system for multiple menu items
- âœ… Built undo/redo system with 50-item history buffer
- âœ… Enhanced form validation with persistent error states
- âœ… Integrated localStorage for state persistence across sessions

**User Experience Impact**: Zero data loss guarantee with advanced state management, auto-save, and draft capabilities.

This systematic approach ensures:
- âœ… Individual bug isolation
- âœ… Safe testing with rollback capability  
- âœ… Zero risk of breaking existing functionality
- âœ… Complete documentation of all changes
