**Type**: Educational Content
**Title**: "5 Inventory Mistakes Costing You ‚Ç±10k+ Monthly"
**Script**:
"Kumusta business owners! I'm [Name] and I almost closed my food business because of inventory disasters.

Here are the 5 mistakes that cost me ‚Ç±50,000 monthly:

1. **Ordering by gut feeling** - I'd order 100 kilos of rice because 'it felt right.' Sometimes I'd run out, sometimes it would spoil.

2. **No sales data** - I had no idea my best-selling item was actually my least profitable.

3. **Manual counting errors** - Staff would miscount, I'd miscount. Always short or over.

4. **No low-stock alerts** - Customers asking for coffee, but we're out of beans. Lost sales = lost money.

5. **Separate payment tracking** - Cash here, GCash there, Maya somewhere else. Impossible to reconcile.

Sound familiar? Comment 'YES' if you've experienced these! 

I built CoreTrack to solve these exact problems. Now I want to share it with fellow Filipino entrepreneurs.

#### Day 4 - Thursday (LinkedIn Article)
**Title**: "Why I Built My Own POS System (And What It Taught Me About Filipino Business)"
**Content**:
"Three years ago, I was a frustrated food business owner losing money daily to inventory chaos and poor tracking systems.

Today, I'm launching the beta for CoreTrack - a POS system built by a Filipino entrepreneur, for Filipino entrepreneurs.

Here's what the journey taught me:

**1. Existing solutions aren't built for our market**
- Most POS systems don't integrate GCash/Maya properly
- They assume stable internet (ha!)
- Pricing models don't fit small business cash flow

**2. Business owners know their problems but lack solutions**
- Everyone struggles with inventory waste
- Manual tracking is universal pain point
- Most want data but don't know how to get it

**3. Authenticity beats marketing**
- When I share my real struggles, people relate
- Fellow entrepreneurs want to support each other
- Genuine problems need genuine solutions

**The Beta Program**
We're looking for 20 businesses to beta test CoreTrack for 6 months (completely free). 

Not because we need users - because we need partners who'll help us build something truly useful for Filipino businesses.

Interested? Comment below or send me a message.

Let's build something great together.

"Update on CoreTrack beta program: 100+ applications in 2 weeks!

What I'm learning about Filipino small businesses:

**1. Everyone has the same 5 problems:**
- Inventory waste (mentioned by 87% of applicants)
- No sales data (mentioned by 92%)
- Manual tracking exhaustion (mentioned by 95%)
- Payment reconciliation nightmares (mentioned by 78%)
- Staff management difficulties (mentioned by 65%)

**2. Existing solutions fail because:**
- Too expensive for small margins
- Don't work offline (crucial in Philippines)
- No local payment integration
- Built for foreign markets

**3. Business owners are hungry for data:**
- Want to know bestselling items
- Need profit margin clarity  
- Desperate for inventory optimization
- Seeking growth insights

**4. Community matters:**
- Referrals from fellow entrepreneurs
- Trust through shared struggles
- Authentic stories beat marketing speak

**Key Insight**: When you solve real problems authentically, the market responds enthusiastically.

Beta program closes soon - if you're struggling with business tracking, there might still be spots available.

'Pre, sobrang ganda ng CoreTrack! First week pa lang nakita ko na na lugi pala ako sa lumpia. Pricing ko mali - ingredients cost ‚Ç±35, selling for ‚Ç±40 lang. Akala ko ‚Ç±15 profit, ‚Ç±5 lang pala! 

Nag-adjust ako to ‚Ç±50, customers pa rin bumibili. Extra ‚Ç±10 per piece x 200 pieces daily = ‚Ç±2000 additional profit daily! 

Salamat talaga brother!'

THIS is why I built CoreTrack! üí™
