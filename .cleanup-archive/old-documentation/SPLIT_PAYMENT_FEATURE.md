## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Split Payment State
const [showSplitPaymentModal, setShowSplitPaymentModal] = useState(false)
const [splitPayments, setSplitPayments] = useState<Array<{
  id: string
  paymentMethod: PaymentMethod
  amount: number
  cashGiven?: number
  change?: number
}>>([])
```

### Core Functions
1. **`getTotalPaidAmount()`**: Calculates total amount paid across all methods
2. **`getRemainingAmount()`**: Determines outstanding balance
3. **`addSplitPayment()`**: Adds new payment with change calculation
4. **`processSplitPaymentOrder()`**: Completes order with split payment data

### Change Calculation Logic
```typescript
// For cash payments, calculate change
if (currentSplitPayment.paymentMethod.type === 'cash') {
  if (cashGiven < currentSplitPayment.amount) {
    alert(`Cash given ($${cashGiven.toFixed(2)}) is less than the amount due`)
    return
  }
  change = cashGiven - currentSplitPayment.amount
}
```
