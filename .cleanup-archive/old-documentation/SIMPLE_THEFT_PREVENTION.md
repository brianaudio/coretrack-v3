# Simple Theft Prevention System

## Core Principle: "Check What Matters Most"

### Daily Quick Check (5 minutes)
Instead of full inventory audit, staff only checks:

1. **Cash Register** - Count cash drawer
2. **3-5 High-Value Items** - Premium ingredients/products
3. **Popular Items** - Fast-moving inventory

### Real-Time POS Alerts
System automatically flags suspicious patterns:
- Large voids/refunds
- Excessive comps
- Missing sales data

### Weekly Full Audit (Optional)
Only when red flags detected during daily checks

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Start Shift
- Staff clicks "Start Shift" 
- System shows "High-Risk Items to Check Today"
- 3-5 items max (not 50+)

### Step 2: Quick Count (During Shift)
- Count only flagged items when convenient
- Takes 2-3 minutes, not 30 minutes

### Step 3: End Shift Automatic Check
- System compares POS sales vs. expected usage
- Shows immediate alerts if something's wrong
- No manual counting required

### Step 4: Investigation (Only If Needed)
- Photo evidence for flagged items
- Manager notification for significant issues
- Full audit only when patterns detected

## Benefits
- ✅ 5 minutes vs 30+ minutes daily
- ✅ Focus on what actually gets stolen
- ✅ Automatic detection vs manual checking
- ✅ Staff-friendly workflow
