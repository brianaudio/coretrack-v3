# Location Management Delete Button Visibility - COMPLETE

## Overview
Modified the `LocationManagement.tsx` component to restrict the visibility of the delete button for locations.

## Change Implemented
The delete button for a location is now only visible to users with the "owner" role. Previously, it was visible to any user who could manage settings.

### Before
```tsx
{canManageSettings() && location.type !== 'main' && (
  <button ...>
    Delete
  </button>
)}
```

### After
```tsx
{isOwner() && location.type !== 'main' && (
  <button ...>
    Delete
  </button>
)}
```

## Reason for Change
This change enhances security by ensuring that only the business owner can delete a location, which is a destructive and irreversible action. Other managers can still edit locations, but they cannot delete them.

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/modules/LocationManagement.tsx`

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE - Delete button visibility is now restricted to the owner.
