## 🇵🇭 **Finally! A POS System Built BY a Filipino Food Business Owner**

### **FOR Filipino Food Business Owners**

---

## **The Problem Every Filipino Food Business Owner Knows**

❌ **Inventory disasters** - Running out of bestsellers, overstocking items that expire  
❌ **No real sales data** - Guessing which items make money, which lose money  
❌ **Manual tracking nightmare** - Notebooks, Excel sheets, mental math  
❌ **Staff management chaos** - No idea who's performing, potential theft issues  
❌ **Multiple payment headaches** - Cash, GCash, Maya all tracked separately  
❌ **Growth limitations** - Can't expand because you can't manage what you have

## **My Story: From ₱50,000 Monthly Losses to Data-Driven Success**

**Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I almost lost my food business to inventory chaos.**

Three years ago, I was losing ₱50,000 every month because I had no idea:
- Which items were actually profitable
- How much inventory I really needed
- If my staff were honest about sales
- Whether my pricing was killing my margins

**I tried every POS system available in the Philippines:**
- Too expensive with hidden fees
- Didn't work offline (crucial here!)
- No GCash/Maya integration
- Built for foreign markets, not Filipino businesses

**So I did what any frustrated entrepreneur would do... I built my own solution.**
