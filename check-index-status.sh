echo "📊 Index Details:"
echo "- Collection: shifts"
echo "- Fields: locationId (ASC), status (ASC), createdAt (DESC)"
echo "- Status: Building..."

echo "⚡ Temporary Workaround Applied:"
echo "- Modified getActiveShift() to use client-side filtering"
echo "- This allows the app to work while the index builds"
echo "- Performance will be optimal once the index is complete"

echo "✅ Your app should now work for shift operations!"
