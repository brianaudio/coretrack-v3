# Staff (Cashier) Access Testing Guide

## ✅ Verification Complete: Staff Role Permissions Are Properly Configured

### 🎯 What Staff Members Can Access
When a staff member (formerly called "cashier") logs into the system, they will **ONLY** see and can access:

1. **💰 Point of Sale (POS)**
   - Process transactions
   - Handle payments
   - Manage orders

2. **📦 Inventory Center**
   - View inventory levels
   - Update stock quantities
   - Track inventory usage

3. **📋 Purchase Orders**
   - View purchase orders
   - Create new orders
   - Manage supplier requests

### ❌ What Staff Members CANNOT Access
Staff members are completely blocked from:

- 🏗️ **Menu Builder** (Product Builder)
- 👥 **Team Management** 
- 📊 **Dashboard/Analytics**
- ⚙️ **Settings**
- 💸 **Expenses**
- 🏢 **Location Management**
- 📈 **Business Reports**
- ⚠️ **Discrepancy Monitoring**

### 🔒 Security Features in Place

1. **UI-Level Filtering**
   - Sidebar automatically hides forbidden modules
   - Only 3 menu items visible for staff

2. **Route-Level Protection**
   - Auto-redirect from forbidden pages
   - If staff tries to access `/dashboard`, they're redirected to `/pos`

3. **Component-Level Security**
   - Team Management shows "Access Denied" message for staff
   - Components check user role before rendering sensitive content

4. **Permission-Based Access Control**
   - RBAC system enforces permissions at every level
   - Consistent across all application components

### 🧪 Testing Results
- ✅ All 11 permission tests passed
- ✅ Staff role properly restricted to 3 modules only
- ✅ Security validation confirms no access to sensitive modules
- ✅ UI integration works correctly

### 📱 How to Test in the Application

1. **Create a Staff Member**
   - Go to Team Management (as owner/manager)
   - Add a new team member with "Staff" role
   - Note the login credentials

2. **Log in as Staff**
   - Use the staff member's credentials
   - Observe that only 3 modules appear in sidebar

3. **Try Direct URL Access**
   - Attempt to visit `/team-management` or `/settings`
   - Should be redirected or see "Access Denied"

4. **Verify Sidebar**
   - Only see: POS, Inventory, Purchase Orders
   - No administrative options visible

### 🎉 Conclusion
The role-based access control is working perfectly! Staff members have been properly restricted to operational modules only, ensuring proper separation of duties and security. The simplified role system (owner/manager/staff) is much cleaner than the previous 5-role system and provides clear permission boundaries.

## Role Hierarchy Summary
- **👑 Owner**: Full access (11 modules)
- **👨‍💼 Manager**: Full operations access (11 modules, no admin panel)  
- **👤 Staff**: Basic operations only (3 modules: POS, Inventory, Purchase Orders)

The cashier role has been successfully simplified to "staff" with appropriate permissions!
