# Branch Delete Buttons Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview
Added delete buttons to branch management interfaces throughout the application to provide comprehensive branch deletion functionality.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **BranchSelector Component** (`/src/components/BranchSelector.tsx`)
- **Added Delete Buttons:** Hover-activated delete buttons for non-main branches
- **Import Changes:** Added auth context and deletion functions
- **Delete Handler:** `handleDeleteBranch()` function with confirmation and proper cleanup
- **UI Enhancement:** 
  - Delete buttons appear on hover for non-main branches
  - Main branch protected with crown icon and no delete option
  - Proper event handling to prevent selection when clicking delete

### 2. **BranchSwitcher Component** (`/src/components/ui/BranchSwitcher.tsx`)
- **Added Delete Buttons:** Trash icon delete buttons for non-main branches
- **Import Changes:** Added Trash2 icon, auth context, and deletion functions
- **Delete Handler:** `handleDeleteBranch()` function with event stopping
- **UI Enhancement:**
  - Group hover effects show delete buttons
  - Consistent styling with red hover states
  - Protected main branch with crown icon

### 3. **LocationManagement Component** (Already Existed)
- **Existing Delete Functionality:** Already had delete buttons for non-main locations
- **No Changes Needed:** Proper implementation was already in place
- **Protection Logic:** Main location deletion prevented with user feedback

## Key Features

### 🛡️ **Main Branch Protection**
- Main branches/locations cannot be deleted in any interface
- Clear visual indicators (crown icon 👑) for main branches
- User-friendly error messages when attempting to delete main branch

### 🗑️ **Smart Delete UI**
- Delete buttons only appear on hover to reduce visual clutter
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
- Consistent styling across all components (red theme for destructive actions)

### 🔄 **Proper Data Cleanup**
- Deletes both location and corresponding branch records
- Refreshes UI automatically after deletion
- Handles edge cases like deleting currently selected branch

### 🎯 **User Experience**
- Hover states provide clear visual feedback
- Event propagation properly handled (delete doesn't trigger selection)
- Loading states and error handling included

## Technical Implementation

### Delete Function Structure
```typescript
const handleDeleteBranch = async (branch: any) => {
  // 1. Check if main branch (protection)
  if (branch.isMain) {
    alert('Cannot delete the main branch.');
    return;
  }
  
  // 2. Confirmation dialog
  if (!confirm(`Delete ${branch.name}? This action cannot be undone...`)) {
    return;
  }

  try {
    // 3. Delete location record
    await deleteLocation(branch.id);
    
    // 4. Delete branch record
    if (profile?.tenantId) {
      await deleteBranchByLocationId(profile.tenantId, branch.id);
    }
    
    // 5. Refresh UI
    refreshBranches();
    
    // 6. Handle currently selected branch edge case
    if (selectedBranch?.id === branch.id) {
      // Context will auto-select another branch
    }
    
  } catch (error) {
    // 7. Error handling
    console.error('Error deleting branch:', error);
    alert('Error deleting branch. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

### UI Pattern
- **Container:** `group` class for hover detection
- **Delete Button:** `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` for smooth reveal
- **Styling:** Red theme (`text-red-400 hover:text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50`)
- **Icon:** Trash2 or trash SVG icons for clear delete indication
